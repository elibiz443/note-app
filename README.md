# README

This is a single-page, reactive note editor with only a single line of custom JavaScript for the flash message animation. You can create, update and delete notes. When clicking on a note, you access the page to create, update and delete dates. On each date, you can add line items. Every time you create, update, or delete a line item, the note total gets updated.

Turbo speeds up Rails applications, reduces the amount of JavaScript we have to write, and makes it easy to work with real-time features. The best part of it is that it's simple to learn.

Generating skeleton of the app:
```
 rails new note-app -T -d postgresql -j esbuild && cd note-app
```

We will run:

* For DB
```
bin/setup
```
* For Server, etc
```
bin/dev
```

###### Note about the bin/setup and the bin/dev scripts:

It is a good practice to have a solid bin/setup script to set up the application for us: install the gems, the JavaScript dependencies, create, migrate and seed the database.

It's almost a must-have when you work in a team, as it should be easy for new developers to set up the development environment. 

Even when working on a small project, using the script has benefits. Every time we need to start from a blank state, we know bin/setup has our back.

The bin/dev script installs foreman locally and runs the application based on the Procfile.dev file. When running the bin/dev command, we are running three commands at once:
```
# Procfile.dev

web: bin/rails server -p 3000
js: yarn build --watch
css: yarn build:css --watch
```
We already know the first command bin/rails server -p 3000 to launch the Rails server. The two other commands yarn build --watch and yarn build:css --watch are defined in the scripts section of the Package.json. They are in charge of precompiling our CSS and JavaScript code before handing them to the asset pipeline. The --watch option is here to ensure the CSS and JavaScript code is compiled every time we save a CSS/Sass or JavaScript file.
